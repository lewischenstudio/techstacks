### What is NestJS?

NestJS is a framework for building efficient, scalable Node.js server-side
applications. It uses modern JavaScript, is built with TypeScript (preserves
compatibility with pure JavaScript) and combines elements of Object-Oriented
Programming, Functional Programming, and Functional Reactive Programming.

### Who developed NestJS? Why did they develop NestJS?

NestJS was developed by Kamil My≈õliwiec, who is a Polish software engineer. He
developed NestJS because he wanted to create a framework that would be easy to
use and would allow developers to create scalable server-side applications.

### When was NestJS first released?

NestJS was first released on October 5, 2016.

### What are some features of the NestJS framework?

Some features of the NestJS framework include its use of TypeScript, support for
multiple database types, and its modular structure.

### How do you install NestJS on your machine?

You can install NestJS by using the Node Package Manager (NPM). To do this, you
will need to first install Node.js on your machine. Once you have Node.js
installed, you can open up your terminal and type in the following command:

```bash
npm install -g @nestjs/cli
```

This will install the NestJS command line interface globally on your machine.
From there, you can create a new NestJS project by running the following
command:

```bash
nest new project-name
```

### Can you explain what TypeScript is and how it relates to NestJS?

TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
It adds optional types to JavaScript that support tools for large-scale
JavaScript applications for the first time. NestJS is a framework for building
efficient, scalable Node.js server-side applications. It uses TypeScript as its
programming language.

### What's the difference between Angular and NestJS?

Angular is a framework for building client-side applications, while NestJS is a
framework for building server-side applications. NestJS is built on top of
TypeScript and Express, and it aims to provide a more robust and scalable
architecture for enterprise-level applications.

### Is it possible to use other languages like Python or Ruby with NestJS? If yes, then how?

Yes, it is possible to use other languages with NestJS. NestJS is language
agnostic, meaning that it can work with any language that can compile to
JavaScript. This includes languages like Python and Ruby. To use a language like
Python or Ruby with NestJS, you will need to use a language-specific compiler to
compile your code to JavaScript.

### What kind of applications can be built using NestJS?

NestJS is a framework for building server-side applications. It is built on top
of TypeScript and Express, and it can be used to build a variety of different
types of applications, from simple REST APIs to full-fledged web applications.

### What are the main components of a NestJS application?

The main components of a NestJS application are the controller, service, and
module. The controller is responsible for handling incoming requests and sending
responses. The service is responsible for business logic and interacting with
data sources. The module is responsible for organizing the application into
cohesive units.

### What are modules and why are they used in NestJS?

Modules are used in NestJS in order to group together related functionality and
provide a higher-level structure for applications. By encapsulating related
functionality into modules, NestJS applications can be more easily organized and
maintained. This also makes it easier to reuse code across different parts of
the application.

### What are controllers and why are they used in NestJS?

Controllers are responsible for handling incoming requests and sending responses
to the client. In NestJS, controllers are used to define routes and map incoming
requests to the appropriate handler functions.

### What are services and why are they used in NestJS?

Services are used in NestJS to encapsulate business logic and provide a way to
share data and functionality between different parts of the application.
Services can be injected into controllers and other services, making them a
powerful tool for modularizing an application.

### What does dependency injection mean in the context of programming? Why is it important for NestJS applications?

Dependency injection is a technique for decoupling the dependencies of a
software component from the component itself. This means that the component can
be used in different contexts without having to change its code. In the context
of NestJS, dependency injection is important because it allows NestJS to provide
the dependencies that a component needs at runtime, instead of having to
hard-code them into the component. This makes NestJS applications more flexible
and easier to change.

### What is an interceptor in the context of NestJS?

Interceptors are functions that can be used to intercept incoming requests to a
NestJS application and perform some sort of pre-processing or manipulation
before the request is handled by the route handler. This can be useful for
things like logging, authentication, or rate-limiting.

### What are guards in the context of NestJS?

Guards are functions that can be used to run checks before a route is executed.
For example, you might use a guard to check if a user is logged in before
allowing them to access a route. Guards can be used to perform all sorts of
checks, and they can be used in combination with each other to create complex
security systems.

### What are pipes in the context of NestJS?

Pipes are a feature of NestJS that allows for the transformation of data before
it is passed to a route handler. This is useful for tasks such as validation or
formatting data. Pipes can be chained together, and they can be used with
middleware to create a powerful data processing pipeline.

### What are middlewares in the context of NestJS?

Middlewares are functions that are executed by NestJS before a request reaches
the final handler. Middlewares can be used for a variety of purposes, such as
logging, authentication, and authorization.

### What testing frameworks work best with NestJS?

NestJS is a Node.js framework, so any testing framework that works with Node.js
will work with NestJS. Some popular options include Jest, Mocha, and Jasmine.

### What databases work best with NestJS?

Any database that works with Node.js will work with NestJS. However, some
databases are better suited for NestJS than others. For example, MongoDB is a
popular choice for NestJS because it is a NoSQL database that is easy to use and
scale.
